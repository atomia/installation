** adjoin script automates process of joining Solaris client to a
   AD domain. It automates the following steps:
   1. Auto-detect Active Directory domain controller. 
   2. Creates a machine account (a.k.a. Computer object) for the
      Solaris host in Active Directory and generates a random
      password for this account. 
   3. Configures the Solaris host as a Kerberos client of AD KDC
      by setting up /etc/krb5/krb5.conf on the Solaris host.
   4. Sets up /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab file on the Solaris host using
      the keys generated for the machine account.
   5. If you run this script as "adleave" (symlink) then it
      deletes the machine account and leaves the AD domain.

** Build the ksetpw program if the binaries are not available
   for your platform
   For Solaris 10 08/07:
% cc -o ksetpw ksetpw.c -R/usr/lib/gss /usr/lib/gss/mech_krb5.so
   For OpenSolaris:
% cc -o ksetpw ksetpw.c -lkrb5

** Configure /etc/resolv.conf to point to AD DNS server
% cat /etc/resolv.conf
domain mydomain.com
search mydomain.com otherdomain.com
nameserver 11.22.33.44

** Use DNS for host resolution
% grep dns /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:      dns files
ipnodes:    dns files

** Restart nscd and dns if resolv.conf or nsswitch.conf were modified
% svcadm restart network/dns/client
% svcadm restart name-service-cache

** In the same directory where you have ksetpw run the adjoin script
      -h to get help
      -n for dry runs
      -f force creation of machine account in AD by deleting existing entry
% ./adjoin -f

** Optional: manually create DNS A and PTR RRs in AD for your client

** Issues:
   1. To use this script with Windows 2008 server, remove "@${realm}" from
      the userPrincipalName otherwise you'll get Authentication error
      # diff adjoin.win2k3 adjoin.longhorn  
      765c765
      < userPrincipalName: host/${fqdn}@${realm}
      ---
      > userPrincipalName: host/${fqdn}
